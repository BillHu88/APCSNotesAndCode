# Class Hierarchies & Interfaces
## Unit Topics
- class hierarchies and polymorphism
- abstract classes
- syntax for calling superclass's constructors and methods
- interfacess
## Inheritance
- In inheritance, you typically have 2 pieces of information that you need: your Superclass and your Subclass (also known as Base class and Derived Class)
- We normally say that your subclass extends your superclass
- ex. `public class Human extends Animal`
- Inheritance represents and IS A(n) relationship between objects
    - an object of a subclass IS A(n) object of the superclass
- Subclass inherits <b>all the fields</b> and <b>methods</b>, but not the constructors.
- use inheritance to define a heirarchy of classes
## Class Hierarchies
- Help reduce duplication of code by factoring out common code from similar classes into a common superclass
