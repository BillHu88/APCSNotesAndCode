## Intro
The bried, general definition of AI
- Ai is the intelligent behavior in an autonomous agent
	- it's describing the brain, not the body, of "intelligent" machines
	- AI != robots
- tasks: driving a car, booking meetings, picking your Netflix Binge
- AGI: artificial general intelligence, when a machine can do things in a way that is indistinguishable from human behavior

## Machine Learning
- Machine learning and AI are <b>not</b> the same
- ML is a component of AI
	- definition: It's the ability for an algorithm to learn from prior data in order to produce a behavior
	- ML is teching machines to make decisions in situation they have never seen
- The most mainstream approach to ML is showing the algorithm a dataset of situations & telling it what the right decision is - training a model
	- supervised Machine Learning
